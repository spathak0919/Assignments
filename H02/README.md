## Definitions

#### Abstraction
> It is the method of hiding unwanted information.

#### Attributes/ Properties
> It is key feature of morden C++ which allows programmer to specify additional information to the compiler to enforce conditions, optimise certain pieces of code or do some specific code generation.

#### Class
> It is a user-defined type or data structure declared with keyword class that has data and functions as its members whose access is governed by the three access specifiers private, protected or public.

#### Class Variable
> It is any variable declared with the static modifier of which a single copy exists, regardless of how many instances of the class exist.

#### Composition
> It allows to create complex classes by combining simpler, more easily manageable parts.

#### Encapsulation
> It is concept to bind together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.

#### Friends
> A function class is defined outside that classd scope which has the right to access all private and protected members of the class.

#### Inheritance
> It is the capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class.

#### Instance Variable
> It is variables that are declared in a class outside any method, constructor or block. These variables are created when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed.

#### Member Variable
> It is a variable that is associated with a specific object, and accessible for all its member fucntions.

#### Method
> It is a procedure associated with a message and an object which allows the sending objects to invoke behaviors and to delegate the implementation of those behaviors to the receiving object.

#### Mutiple Inheritance
> It is a feature of C++ where a class can inherit from more than one classes.

#### Object 
> It is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

#### Overloading
> Its function is to specify more than one definition for a function name or an operator in the same scope.

#### Polymorphism
> It is a call to a member function will cause a different function to be executed depending on the type of object that invokes the function.

#### public/private/protected
> public - members are accessible from outside the class.
> private - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class.
> protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes.

#### virtual 
> It is a member function that can be redefined in a derived class, while preserving its calling properties through references.
